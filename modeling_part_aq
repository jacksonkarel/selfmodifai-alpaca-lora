            `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`) and 2 additional tensors of shape
            `(batch_size, num_heads, encoder_sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`.

            Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
            blocks) that can be used (see `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.

            If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids` (those that
            don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)` instead of all
            `decoder_input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
        inputs_embeds (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
            Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
            is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
            model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
        use_cache (`bool`, *optional*):
            If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
            `past_key_values`).
        output_attentions (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
            tensors for more detail.
        output_hidden_states (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
            more detail.
        return_dict (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return a [`~utils.ModelOutput`] instead of a plain tuple.
