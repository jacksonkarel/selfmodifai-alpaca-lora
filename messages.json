However, I can suggest some ideas that can help you to improve its performance. Here are a few suggestions to make the model more powerful:\n\n1. Increase the model size: Increasing the number of layers and attention heads can lead to better performance.\n\n2. Utilize advanced architectures: Consider using transformer-based architectures like BERT, GPT-3, or T5, which are known for their state-of-the-art performance.\n\n3. Pretrain on domain-specific data: When training the model, use a dataset that is more specific to the problem you're trying to solve. This can lead to better contextual understanding by the model.\n\n4. Apply transfer learning: Make use of pre-trained models and adapt them to your specific use case with fine-tuning on your dataset to save time and achieve better results.\n\n5. Optimize training parameters: Experimenting with different learning rates, batch sizes, and optimizers can lead to better performance.\n\n6. Use advanced training techniques: Techniques like model distillation, where a large, cumbersome model is used to teach a smaller, faster model, can help improve model performance.\n\n7.
